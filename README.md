# Microblog

This was a project I worked on to better understand how the Python framework [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) worked. I wanted to incorporate this framework into my tool set so that I could build my own front facing web applications that integrate things I've learned whilst studying Machine Learning. Most of this project was created by following alongside Miguel Grinberg's
*"The Flask Mega-Tutorial"* which could be found on his [blog](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world), or purchased on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3MQffrm).
